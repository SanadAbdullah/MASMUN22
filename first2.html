            SPECPOL, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, is established to address prominent political issues and decolonization-related topics within the second half of the twentieth century. SPECPOL primarily deals with a wide set of political issues that have taken place all over the globe; however, the fundamental key in this committee lies in the wide range of concerns delegates must comprehend beforehand, including: the effects of decolonization and global politics on the people, the impacts of fluctuating economies, environments, and societies. Indeed, delegates will debate about the effects of those issues and what policies must be put in place to stop them from escalating or creating more implications.

    <p class="para">South Africa was formally colonized in 1652. Apart from the European colonization being executed from the south of the continent; South Africa experienced a movement and intrusion of individual groups from the north. The imposition of European colonial control on the South African communities resulted in a rapid series of changes. Indeed, the pace with which change happened distinguished the colonial era from preceding times in South Africa. Of course, not all cultures were revolutionized in the same way. For long periods of time, some people resisted the pressures of colonial encroachment, slavery, and forced labor. Others, like the Khoikhoi villages of the south-western Cape, vanished in a matter of decades.

    <p class="para">
      In recent years, ownership of the South China Sea has emerged as a key issue in Asian foreign policy. China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Philippines all have territorial claims to South China Sea islands. According to international sea regulations established by the United Nations in 1981, the borders of sovereign states contain a "exclusive economic zone" (EEC) that extends 200 nautical miles from the shoreline. Despite this, China asserts sovereignty over the South China Sea all the way to Malaysia by specifically asserting historical ownership of the zone. On the other hand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and others are seeking to evade international law by creating minor settlements on islands in order to legitimate their claims to the sea and oppose China's aggressive military expansion.
