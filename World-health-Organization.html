            The World health organization is the coordinating and planning committee on worldwide wellbeing and welfare. “Health,” as characterized within the WHO structure, is the state of total physical, mental, and social wellbeing, and not simply the absence of illness or infirmity. Indeed, the aforementioned points are what this committee aims to establish, that is the improvement of societies by tackling the issues stemming from the roots of citizens: mental, physical, and social health. The main objective of the World Health Organization is to strengthen humanitarian aid by ensuring the highest conceivable level of wellbeing around the world. From moral dilemmas to humanitarian crises, delegates will debate to find the best policies to resolve the issue.

    <p class="para">New genetic innovations are both exciting and frightening. To avoid health issues, society may be able to conquer illnesses by modifying individual genomes or selecting certain embryos. However, it may also give rise to "super-humans" who are optimized for specific features (such as intelligence or appearance) and worsen societal disparities. What is certain is that people will be able to make decisions about their lives in ways that were impossible in the past, when we relied more on random evolution than deliberation. In the words of Jamie Metzl, we are "Hacking Darwin," the title of his latest book. It is a thoughtful romp through new genetic technologies, with insights on what it means for individuals, society and even great-power politics.

      More than 5.2 million people in Tigray, Ethiopia, are in dire need of humanitarian support, including health care, due to the conflict that erupted at the end of 2020. The conflict has left thousands injured and traumatized and had a severe impact on the families’ lives and livelihoods. Additionally, people are suffering from trauma and injuries, food insecurity and malnutrition, sexual and gender-based violence, communicable diseases such as malaria, cholera, as well as reduced access to treatment for non-communicable diseases and maternal and child health services. Furthermore, the conflict has also disrupted the COVID-19 response. Millions of people are facing acute food insecurity in the region, with over 400 000 people close to famine.
