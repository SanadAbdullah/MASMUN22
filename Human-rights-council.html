            The Human Rights Council is one of many primary international governmental bodies inside the United Nations that focuses chiefly on addressing and tackling topics of human rights violations. The council receives numerous reports from a series of real-life events taking place in our world and works to establish uncommon yet impactful strategies to solve the issues at hand. Moreover, this council is involved in enforcing its capacity to secure human rights around the world, for the primary goal here is to re-establish an agenda of rules that secure the rights of nations and their victims. In this committee, delegates will cooperate and work hand in hand to create resolutions and regulations that work to secure the rights and liberties of those wrongfully treated.

      <p class="para">“Every journalist killed or neutralized by terror is an observer less of the human condition. Every attack distorts reality by creating a climate of fear and self-censorship”

      <p class="para">
        There has been troubling evidence in recent years of the scale and number of attacks on the physical safety of journalists and media workers, as well as incidents affecting their ability to exercise freedom of expression through threats of prosecution, arrest, imprisonment, denial of journalistic access, and failures to investigate and prosecute crimes against them. Furthermore, according to IFEX, the perpetrators of these crimes are never punished in nine out of 10 cases. Freedom of expression is an individual right for which no one should be murdered; nevertheless, it is also a social right that empowers populations by promoting conversation, participation, and democracy, and therefore enables independent and sustainable growth. An educated, engaged citizen cannot exist in the absence of freedom of expression, notably freedom of the press.

        Only days after the US forces left Afghanistan, the Taliban gained control of key towns and established themselves in Kabul's presidential palace. Uncertainty reigns supreme, with many Afghans yearning to flee their homeland. “Afghans are caught between Taliban oppression and the spectra of starvation,” said Patricia Gossman. Following the US- led invasion, the Taliban regrouped over the border in Pakistan and started taking domain less than ten years after their ouster. Furthermore, by year of 2021, the Taliban had seized most major cities, counting the capital of Kabul. Moreover, the Taliban are most likely to force cruel run on the show, in spite of their vows to regard rights of women and minor individuals, they face many obstacles in providing Afghans with security, health services, and economic opportunities.
