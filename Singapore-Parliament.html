            The Singapore Parliament is a unique committee that can alter the course of events across history; thus, impacting nations, societies, and individuals tremendously. This committee will begin in 2008, everything before 2008 will be the same; however, the events that take place after 2008 depend completely on the choices the delegates and their directors choose to make; therefore, rewriting history and every subtle event in between. Each delegate will represent a parliament member and are assigned into either opposition or People’s Action Party (PAP). Nonetheless, for delegates to win, they must accomplish their secret agendas by using tactics that will benefit their respected parties and positions.

    <p class="para">Singapore officially slid into recession on October 8th, 2008 after falling consumer demand from the US and Europe hammered its manufacturing exports. Almost the whole world suffered during the Great Recession that took place in the United States from 2007-2008; however, Singapore is notable one of many countries that had its economy succumb under immense stress. Many measures were taken to solve the issues at hand, yet none were able to prevent Singaporean workers from losing their jobs. For instance, Government statistics show that the number of unemployed graduates more than doubled in December 2008, rising from 6,200 a year earlier to 14,800. On the other hand, the finance sector and other advances service industries were hit particularly hard by the crisis and many had to report hue losses in their reserves. Similarly, many Singaporean citizens were forced to immigrate out of Singapore and choose to reside in nearby, more affluent countries to earn a proper living since the recession of Singapore’s economy left many hungry and jobless.
