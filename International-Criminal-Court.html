            The International Criminal Court is partaking in a worldwide battle to end exemption, and through worldwide criminal equity, the International Criminal Court holds to assist and anticipate rights violations from never happening again. As a court of last resort, it seeks to complement, not replace the national courts. Moreover, the crimes that are associated within the International Criminal Court are war crimes including: torturing, corporal punishment, acts of terrorism, and genocide which includes all acts intended to ruin a national, ethnic, or religious group. Moreover, the prosecution of crimes against humanity, such as murder, torture, and rape. Indeed, since this committee is a court simulator, councils, instead of delegates, will either defend or prosecute the person on trial. Correspondingly, the judges moderate the trial, sustain objections, and ask the witnesses questions.Â

      Joseph Stalin was the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's secretary-general and premier of the Soviet state for a quarter-century, dictatorially ruling the Soviet Union and transforming it into an international power. Stalin industrialized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, forced the modernization of agriculture, and used police brutality to solidify his power. Furthermore, he continuously purged the Communist party, for Ninety three of the 139 Central Committee members were killed and 81 of the 103 generals and admirals were executed. Also, three million people were accused of opposing Communism, and they were sent to the gulag, a system of labor camps in Siberia, all under the control of Joseph Stalin.
