                Greetings, everyone!
                <br><br>
                On behalf of the Modern American School Model United Nations, it is my honor to invite you to the 8th annual MASMUN conference. After a long halt from the MUN experience due to COVID-19, I hope you are all as excited as we are to revive the spark of debate that MUN has to offer!
                <br><br>
                On that note, it is our priority to ensure a convenient environment for the blooming of new ideas and the pursuit of our goal: a true, positive contribution to our society. That, of course, can only be done once we stand hand in hand in the face of the adversities we experience as a human race; to reach for the stars by looking beyond our bureaucracy, for the sake of the people remains our one sturdy solution.
                <br><br>
                “You have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars, to change the world,” said Harriet Tubman, a woman who serves as a true inspiration. A woman that stands forward and with the mindset of dedicating every day to reach for what is beyond our expectations of today’s world and to break through the barrier that hinders us from reaching ultimate justice for each member of humanity.
                <br><br>
                Such inspiration led us to this year’s theme for MASMUN: “Urgency for Justice”! Indeed, it is a phrase that pinpoints our crucial role in tackling humanity’s most pressing contemporary issues facing the achievement of the 17 sustainable development goals. With that idea at hand, our staff has selected committee topics geared to provoke a sense of hope regarding the challenges we face trying to reach such goals; we are optimistic to see the results you come up with!
                <br><br>
                While MASMUN is merely a simulation of the actual UN, the sole concept of us coming together to investigate global matters adequately proves that the idea of MUN expands further than what meets the eye. “There's no such thing as the United Nations. If the U.N. secretary building in New York lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.” stated Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, highlighting the idea that no matter the establishment, we as the younger generation can still be as effective as the United Nations itself. How effective we are, on the other hand, all depends on our personal effort.
                <br><br>
                The Secretariat and I are excited to announce that MASMUN VIII will be held in-person on March 24th! Registration is now open for delegates, chairs, and presidents to fill out. We ultimately hope that each and every participant, regardless of their responsibility within the conference, leaves with a more open-minded and solution-oriented outlook on life. I’m looking forward to meeting you all at MASMUN!
                <br><br>
                Yours truly,
                <br><br>
                Dina Alami, Secretary-General

            <p class="waleed">
                On behalf of the Secretariat team, I welcome you all to MASMUN’22! I am thrilled to observe your creativity roam free with this conference’s theme: “Urgency for Justice.” The theme came about from a great deal of suffering, oppression and marginalization experienced by various minorities around the world. From Atlanta, Georgia to Kabul, Afghanistan, our world suffers due to the corruption that plagues every government and social construct. In such times as ours, the bright thinkers of the future, the youth, become our only hope. In Malcom X’s immortal words, <i>“Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it."</i> Delegates, the world’s fate rests on your shoulders. Make posterity proud!
                <br><br>
                Deputy Secretary General, Al-Waleed Al-Janabi
