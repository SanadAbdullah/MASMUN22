    <p class="para">Singapore officially slid into recession on October 8th, 2008 after falling consumer demand from the US and Europe hammered its manufacturing exports. Almost the whole world suffered during the Great Recession that took place in the United States from 2007-2008; however, Singapore is notable one of many countries that had its economy succumb under immense stress. Many measures were taken to solve the issues at hand, yet none were able to prevent Singaporean workers from losing their jobs. For instance, Government statistics show that the number of unemployed graduates more than doubled in December 2008, rising from 6,200 a year earlier to 14,800. On the other hand, the finance sector and other advances service industries were hit particularly hard by the crisis and many had to report hue losses in their reserves. Similarly, many Singaporean citizens were forced to immigrate out of Singapore and choose to reside in nearby, more affluent countries to earn a proper living since the recession of Singapore’s economy left many hungry and jobless.
